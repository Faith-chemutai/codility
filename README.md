## question one
Complete the function that

accepts two integer arrays of equal length
compares the value each member in one array to the corresponding member in the other
squares the absolute value difference between those two values
and returns the average of those squared absolute value difference between each member pair.

## question two
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

## question three
Just a simple sorting usage. Create a function that returns the elements of the input-array / list sorted in lexicographical order.

## question four
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

## question five
Welcome to the Codewars Bar!
Codewars Bar recommends you drink 1 glass of water per standard drink so you're not hungover tomorrow morning.

Your fellow coders have bought you several drinks tonight in the form of a string. Return a string suggesting how many glasses of water you should drink to not be hungover.

## question six
Write a function that returns a (custom) FizzBuzz sequence of the numbers 1 to 100.

The function should be able to take up to 4 arguments:

The 1st and 2nd arguments are strings, "Fizz" and "Buzz" by default;
The 3rd and 4th arguments are integers, 3 and 5 by default.
Thus, when the function is called without arguments, it will return the classic FizzBuzz sequence up to 100:

[ 1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, ... 14, "FizzBuzz", 16, 17, ... 98, "Fizz", "Buzz" ]
When the function is called with (up to 4) arguments, it should return a custom FizzBuzz sequence, for example:

('Hey', 'There')      -->  [ 1, 2, "Hey", 4, "There", "Hey", ... ]
('Foo', 'Bar', 2, 3)  -->  [ 1, "Foo", "Bar", "Foo", 5, "FooBar", 7, ... ]

## question seven
Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

If you like this Kata, maybe try this one next: https://www.codewars.com/kata/represent-array-of-numbers-as-ranges

1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ] though? (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )
